# Codemate Hackathon 

## Building a Python Based Command Terminal

	•	Built a web-based Python terminal that runs in the browser.
	•	Used Flask (backend) to process commands and return results via an API.
	•	Designed an interactive frontend (index.html) with a styled terminal UI, live autocomplete suggestions, and a working clear screen.
	•	Made the project deployable via GitHub so it can run as a hosted web app.
